# WeatherCast - to the get forecast across the globe

this webaoo is a forecasting application created using reactJS and [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

List of OpenWeatherMap APIs used: 

- [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current)
- [Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)
- [5 day / 3 hour forecast data](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

Things that can be considered for future iterations:

- Work with Google's JavaScript MAP API and places API to enhance and take this to next level. Tried getting the API_KEY from google but failed :(.
